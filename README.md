# Hollow House Academy (HHA)

Hollow House Academy is a governance-first educational framework designed to support children, families, organizations, and communities through ethical, joyful, and developmentally respectful learning.

This repository is structured to ensure:
- Human authority is explicit
- AI is governed, constrained, and transparent
- Educational drift is visible and auditable
- Learning is fractal, not linear
- Safety and dignity are non-negotiable

This is not a content dump.
This is an operating system for education.
