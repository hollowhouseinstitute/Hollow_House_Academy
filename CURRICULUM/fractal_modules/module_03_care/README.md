# Module 03 — Care

## Core Idea
Care is something we practice, not something we earn.

## Story
A child waters a plant.
Some days it grows, some days it rests.

## Play / Activity
Care for something small today.
A plant, a toy, yourself.

## Reflection Question
How does care feel in your body?

## Adult Note
No fixing. No teaching moment.
Presence is enough.
