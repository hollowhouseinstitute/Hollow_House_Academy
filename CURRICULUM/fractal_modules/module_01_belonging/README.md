# Module 01 — Belonging

## Core Idea
Everyone belongs without earning it.

## Story

One day it is injured and cannot help.
The forest stays anyway.

## Play / Activity
Create a space (blanket, pillow, drawing) that feels safe.
No explanation required.

## Reflection Question

## Adult Note
Do not correct the answer.
Silence is also an answer.
