# Governance Framework

This academy follows Hollow House Institute governance principles.

## Core Rules
1. Human authority is supreme
2. Child safety overrides optimization
3. No opaque AI behavior
4. Drift must be detectable
5. Systems must stop when uncertain

## Change Control
Changes affecting:
- curriculum logic
- AI behavior
- safety boundaries

require explicit human approval.

## Drift Visibility
All adaptations, failures, or conflicts are logged in AUDIT/.
